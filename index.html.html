      <h2>SHORT HISTORY OF CHRIST COMMUNICATIONS EVANGELISTIC MINISTRIES, IGBUSI</h2>
        <h3>The humble beginning of Christ Communications Evangelistic Ministries began in 1994 when God show the then president of Christ Apostolic Church Students’ Association Iree branch, then a student of OND Science Laboratory Technology by name brother Olugbemi Oludayo a vision mandating him on an evangelistic mission. He ran with this vision for 21 years during which things were upside down for him. 
        I usually remember what my mother Mrs B. T. Fagbemi (of blessed memory) told me when I grew up to know between right and left that when she gave birth to me that she had a strange birth of me out of all her children. Then she told me that a C/S Church prophet told her that this son of yours shall be a minister of God, so take good care of him. And that as a mark of his separation, his hair should be left uncut. She told me however that she later cut my hair after I am beginning to look different from other children years after. 
        I furthered my education and graduated with HND Biochemistry, PGD in HIV Education and management and Public Administration respectively, and PGD in Theology at the Redeemed Christian Bible College in 2013.</h3>

        <h3>However, God of covenant always come calling. 
        So He moved him to clear his long time portion of land meant for his personal building/business site for CCEM to live in and at same time start his long time call to the ministry at Igbusi on Thursday 26th of November 2015. Though for some reason I presently live in Alagbado for some reason. 
        
        The ground was cleared for the church on the said date and burnt on the second day. The excavation started on Saturday 28th of November 2015 by a team of workers which extended to Sunday 29th. 
        The foundation laying ceremony was conducted Pastor Abosede (AGE) of the CAC, supported by the visioner, Evang. Olugbemi and other team of workers which lasted for about 20 minutes.  
        Laminated printed scriptures where laid at the four corners of the church building in between three representative stones at each corner totaling twelve stones in all.</h3>  
        <br>
        <h3>The biblical scriptures used were: 
        Ephesian 2:20: And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief corner stone
        I Corinthian 3:11: For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ
        I Peter 2:6: Wherefore also as it is contained in the scripture, Behold I lay I Sion a chief coenerstone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded.
        Revelation 1:8: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
        The scriptures were uttered and laid in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. 
        Hymns were sang and rounded off with a word of prayer for God’s presence in the church henceforth by Pastor Abosede (AGE).</h3> 
        <br>
        <h3>A total of building offering of N1,370 was collect for the ceremony.</h3>
        <h3>The first Sunday service of CHRIST COMMUNICATIONS EVANGELISTIC MINISTRY  was held on this land on the 7th of January 2016.</h3>

        <h2>THE VISION</h2>
        <h3>Christ Communications Evangelistic Ministries was established in 2016 by divine revelation through the missioner Evang. Olugbemi Oludayo for the purpose of taking the gospel of Christ to the unreached through evangelism, raising a voice in the wilderness of the world, to make straight the way of the Lord before His coming, and raising up a generation of young ones who know God.  We have been committed to this noble course ever since, doing all we can to ensure this vision is realized. And we want to do more for the Lord in our evangelical assignment. 
        And the Lord had been faithful ever since.
        We are glad to have your presence in our midst today, and will gladly take delivery of whatever God lays on your heart to give to the church for the progress of the work of God in the rural area.</h3>
